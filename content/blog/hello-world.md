Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet :smile:.<br />
This is my devblog, a small nook on the internet to share my experiences
and experiments.

<!--more-->

I am using the all-powerful [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the
[Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) theme.
The site is stored on Github and hosted on Vercel. Hopefully, I'll
transition to my own design soon!

Currently I am fascinated by Emacs and keep discovering new things
almost daily, I will also catalogue my journey with Emacs here.

I frequently come across links to useful stuff & compulsively send them
to people. If you know me, you know what I'm talking about. I'll try
posting them here instead for future reference.<br />
I'm already at my wit's end writing a Hello World post, how will I write
enough to sustain this blog :weary: Let's hope I do, I really like the
aesthetics of the current theme :D

I'm active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/seshaljain/) these days,
come interact!

Until next time.
