title: "Uses"
---

These are the tools I use regularly. Check out other cool setups at <https://uses.tech/> :computer:

I'm mostly active on my 12.5" Dell Latitude E7250 Ultrabook. Although slightly aged, it is super-lightweight (1200g) and I enjoy typing on the chiclet keyboard.  
Ubuntu 20.04 with GNOME is my primary OS; I'm testing out Manjaro i3 on a VM (exploring ArchLinux atm).  
I'm looking forward to switching to the [Programmer Dvorak](https://www.kaufmann.no/roland/dvorak/) keyboard layout ASAP; currently I keep dual layouts and practice on [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) whenever I get a chance.

[Emacs 27.1](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is my go-to program for almost anything related to text, with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) coming in when in a pinch, especially for web-related projects.  
I use the [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/) with [Iosevka](https://typeof.net/Iosevka/) as the monospace font. I love [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter/) for UI, in fact this website uses Inter as the primary typeface.

[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/) is my browser of choice and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) for times when Firefox falls short. [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) efficiently blocks ads on the browsers for me.

I read digitally on [Foliate](https://johnfactotum.github.io/foliate/) on PC, [ReadEra](https://readera.org/en/book-reader) on mobile and my Kindle Paperwhite.

## This website's tech stack

_KISS — Keep it simple, stupid!_

This blog is generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with the [Hello Friend](https://github.com/panr/hugo-theme-hello-friend) theme. The site is stored on Github and deployed via Vercel. Hopefully, I'll transition to my own design soon!  
All pre- & post-processing of source files is handled natively by Hugo via Hugo Pipes.  
I like the simplicity of the setup, and avoid bringing in unnecessary JS build tools. But hey — to each, their own.
